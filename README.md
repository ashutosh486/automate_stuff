# Automate Stuff

I have created this repository as a hobby project where I will be uploading new automation task as and when I have slight inconvinience.

## **Project 1:** automate_instagram
So as an experimentation I have automated a page on Instagram: [2senthorror](https://www.instagram.com/2senthorror)
